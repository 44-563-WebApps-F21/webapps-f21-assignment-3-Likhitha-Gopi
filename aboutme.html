        <h1>SpiderMan</h1>
        <p>
            Spider-Man, costumed champion of the innocent who lives and fights with the wisdom of “With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!” and 
            spider-like abilities. Like his namesake, Spider-Man’s strength and agility stand far above those of the average human, allowing him to lift nearly ten tons and to leap and move at incredible speeds with high accuracy.
